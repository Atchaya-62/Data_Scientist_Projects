  Predicts student scores based on study-related features using Linear Regression.

### 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **SVM – [Banknote_Authentication](https://github.com/Atchaya-62/Banknote_Authentication)**  
  A machine-learning app using SVM to detect authentic vs fake bank notes.  
  Includes a trained model, scaler, and a Streamlit web interface.  

### 🔹 Decision Tree
- [car_evaluation_model](https://github.com/Atchaya-62/car_evaluation_model)  
  A Decision Tree–based model to evaluate cars based on various attributes.  

### 🔹 Random Forest Regression

  A Machine Learning–based House Price Prediction app built using Random Forest Regression.  
  Deployed as an interactive Streamlit interface for instant property value estimates.  

### 🔹 Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes – [Movie_Review_Analyzer](https://github.com/Atchaya-62/Movie_Review_Analyzer)**  
  A Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer built using Multinomial Naive Bayes, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit.  

### 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **KNN – [Customer_Purchase_prediction](https://github.com/Atchaya-62/Customer_Purchase_prediction)**  
  A model that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on age, gender, salary, etc.  
  Built using KNN with a clean preprocessing pipeline and deployed as a web app.  

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
